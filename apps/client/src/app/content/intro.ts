I'm a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada and also a
communication and journalism student. I enjoy creating things that live
on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in
between. I have been freelancing for a year now while studying at the
 university and I've manage to gain a decent amount of experience and
valuable knowledge from all different kinds of fields throughout my
projects/work.`;
